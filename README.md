# Ad counter extension
My first google chrome extension. It's a simple counter that displays how many ads have been detected on the website you are on.
Technologies used: JavaScript, HTML

Â¿What did I learn?
I learned the logic behind google chrome extensions, including the background processes, the importance of having a listener and the basics of JavaScript.
